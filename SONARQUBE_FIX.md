# SonarQube Coverage Fix - Summary

## Problem
SonarQube was showing 0% test coverage despite tests existing in the project. The coverage report showed only 7 out of 2986 lines covered (0.23%).

## Root Causes

### 1. Missing Test Configuration
- No `pyproject.toml` file with pytest configuration
- pytest-cov plugin was installed but not configured
- No specification of what to cover or where tests are located

### 2. Import Path Issues
- Source code uses relative imports (without `src.` prefix)
- Tests needed proper Python path configuration to find modules
- Added `pythonpath = ["src"]` to pytest configuration

### 3. Missing Database Models
- Several model classes were referenced in `ccs_repository.py` but not defined:
  - `BillingInvoiceTotalDifference`
  - `Configuration`
  - `DataSource`
  - `Flight`
  - `FlightDate`
  - `InvoiceHistory`
  - `PriceReport`
- Added stub implementations to allow tests to run

### 4. CI/CD Missing Test Step
- GitHub Actions workflow didn't run tests before SonarQube scan
- No coverage.xml file was generated in CI/CD pipeline

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created `pyproject.toml`
```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["src/tests"]
python_files = "test_*.py"
python_classes = "Test*"
python_functions = "test_*"
pythonpath = ["src"]
addopts = [
    "-v",
    "--strict-markers",
    "--cov=src",
    "--cov-report=xml:coverage.xml",
    "--cov-report=html:htmlcov",
    "--cov-report=term-missing",
    "--junitxml=test-results.xml",
]
```

### 2. Added Missing Model Classes
Added stub implementations to `src/models/schema_ccs.py` for all missing models. **These need to be properly implemented with the correct columns based on your actual database schema.**

### 3. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow
Modified `.github/workflows/build.yml` to:
- Set up Python environment
- Install dependencies
- Run tests with coverage before SonarQube scan

### 4. Fixed Import Statements
- Removed unnecessary `src.` prefix from imports in test files
- Configured pytest to add `src/` to Python path automatically

## Results

**Before:**
- Coverage: 0.23% (7 out of 2986 lines)
- Tests: Not running
- SonarQube: Not detecting tests

**After:**
- Coverage: 35% (683 out of 1966 lines)
- Tests: 35 tests passing ✅
- SonarQube: Will now properly see coverage data

## How to Run Tests Locally

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest src/tests/test_ccs_file_readers_service.py

# Run without coverage (faster)
pytest --no-cov

# View HTML coverage report
open htmlcov/index.html  # or xdg-open on Linux
```

## Next Steps

### 1. **URGENT: Implement Proper Model Classes**
The stub models in `schema_ccs.py` need proper implementation with actual database columns. Review your database schema and add the correct column definitions for:
- BillingInvoiceTotalDifference
- Configuration
- DataSource
- Flight
- FlightDate
- InvoiceHistory
- PriceReport

### 2. Add More Tests
Currently only testing `ccs_file_readers_service.py`. You should add tests for:
- `reconciliation_service.py` (currently 8% coverage)
- `reconciliation_repository.py` (currently 22% coverage)
- `ccs_repository.py` (currently 19% coverage)
- Other service and repository files

### 3. Improve Coverage
Target areas with low coverage:
- Common utilities (0% coverage)
- API endpoints (0% coverage)
- Service methods not yet tested

### 4. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add pyproject.toml
git add src/models/schema_ccs.py
git add src/tests/conftest.py
git add .github/workflows/build.yml
git add SONARQUBE_FIX.md
git commit -m "fix: Configure pytest and coverage for SonarQube integration

- Add pyproject.toml with pytest and coverage configuration
- Add missing database model stubs to schema_ccs.py
- Update GitHub Actions to run tests before SonarQube scan
- Fix import paths in test configuration
- Coverage improved from 0.23% to 35%"
git push
```

### 5. Verify in CI/CD
After pushing, check that:
- GitHub Actions runs tests successfully
- SonarQube receives and displays the coverage report
- No import errors in CI environment

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `pyproject.toml` - Created
2. ✅ `src/models/schema_ccs.py` - Added missing models
3. ✅ `src/tests/conftest.py` - Fixed imports
4. ✅ `.github/workflows/build.yml` - Added test execution
5. ✅ `coverage.xml` - Now properly generated with 35% coverage
6. ✅ `test-results.xml` - Now properly generated with test results

## Configuration Verified

- ✅ SonarQube properties correct in `sonar-project.properties`
- ✅ Coverage report path: `coverage.xml`
- ✅ Test results path: `test-results.xml`
- ✅ Source directory: `src`
- ✅ Test directory: `src/tests`
